# SortAnal
<p>This Programming Assignment is based on Levitin Exercise 2.6 # 2abc. You need to follow the specifications given below.</p>
<p>Implement the algorithm and "driver" in Java.</p>
<p>For 2b, I want you to show your work and justify your hypothesis. I will be grading you on your justification as well as the programming.</p>
<ul>
<li>In addition to running the algorithm on the random arrays as indicated in 2a, I also want you to run the algorithm against the arrays sorted in ascending order, and then again on arrays already sorted in descending order. Perform the analysis for all three situations.</li>
<li>Most people will create a spreadsheet or some kind of table with both actual and hypothetical values.</li>
<li>You may also graph the data. If you don't justify your conclusion, you will not receive full credit.</li>
<li>Make sure you provide a formula for the <em>actual time efficiency</em>, and not merely the algorithm's order of growth.</li>
<li>Your program should run the approximately 60 tests (three runs of 20) in one invocation.&nbsp;Your program should require no user interaction.</li>
<li>Your program should provide output either to standard output (the terminal, by default) in a form that can be simply copy and pasted into a spreadsheet.</li>
<li>Make sure you correctly code the book's algorithm, and your counter is correctly counting the comparisons. The comparison count should be exact, not merely approximate.</li>
<li>Do not change the algorithm; you may of course modify the code counting the number of comparisons.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The best way to test your code is to invoke it with several small arrays, so you can manually verify the results.</li>
<li>Follow good coding practices. For example, you should use loops rather than replicating your code 20 times.</li>
<li>Follow good version control practices. Commit early and often. (E.g., submissions with only a single commit are suspect.)
</ul>
<p>Submit both the program source code and electronic documents with your analysis and justification.</p>
<p>All programs should follow good style conventions: good comments; good variable names; proper indention. Include your name near the beginning of every file.</p>
<p>Questions? Zulip.</p>
<p><strong>I encourage and expect questions and discussion on this all programming assignments.</strong></p>
